      Hello! My name is Adam Johnson. After graduating from Arizona State University, I worked for several years as a professional musician, before I decided it was time to explore other career options. <br></br>
      <br></br>
      I began my journey as a web developer in April of 2023, once again through Arizona State University. I instantly became hooked on the problem-solving that is so abundant in the field of web development, and I'm excited to continue on this journey and build my skills.
